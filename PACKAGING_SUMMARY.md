- ✅ Dependencies properly listed
- ✅ Console script entry point: `schema-graph-builder`
- ✅ Proper PyPI classifiers

### 4. **Testing & Validation**
- ✅ All imports work correctly
- ✅ Package can be imported programmatically
- ✅ CLI functionality preserved
- ✅ High-level API works
- ✅ Example script validates functionality

## 📦 How to Use the Package

### Installation Options

**Option 1: Development Install**
```bash
pip install -e .
```

**Option 2: Build and Install**
```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
pip install dist/schema-graph-builder-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

**Option 3: Upload to PyPI**
```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/*
```

### Usage Examples

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# After installation
schema-graph-builder postgres

# Or directly
python -m schema_graph_builder.cli postgres
```

**Programmatic Usage:**
```python
from schema_graph_builder import SchemaGraphBuilder

builder = SchemaGraphBuilder()
result = builder.analyze_database(
    db_type="postgres",
    config_path="config/db_connections.yaml"
)
```

**Low-level API:**
```python
from schema_graph_builder import extract_schema, infer_relationships, build_graph

schema = extract_schema("postgres", "config/db_connections.yaml")
relationships = infer_relationships(schema)
build_graph(schema, "output/relationships.yaml", visualize=True)
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### Professional Package Structure
- ✅ Proper package hierarchy
- ✅ Clean imports and exports
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Both CLI and programmatic interfaces

### Easy Integration
- ✅ Can be imported as `from schema_graph_builder import SchemaGraphBuilder`
- ✅ Console script available after installation
- ✅ All dependencies properly managed
- ✅ Config files and examples included

### Development Features
- ✅ Optional development dependencies (`pip install -e .[dev]`)
- ✅ Testing framework ready (`pip install -e .[test]`)
- ✅ Code quality tools specified

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Distribution
1. **Update metadata** in `setup.py` (author, email, URL)
2. **Add license** file if needed
3. **Test thoroughly** in different environments
4. **Upload to PyPI** for public distribution

### For Development
1. **Add tests** using pytest
2. **Set up CI/CD** for automated testing
3. **Add documentation** (Sphinx/ReadTheDocs)
4. **Consider type hints** for better IDE support

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Script-based)
- ❌ Had to clone entire repository
- ❌ Complex setup process
- ❌ No clean programmatic API
- ❌ Direct file execution only

### After (Package-based)
- ✅ `pip install schema-graph-builder`
- ✅ Clean import: `from schema_graph_builder import SchemaGraphBuilder`
- ✅ Console command: `schema-graph-builder postgres`
- ✅ Professional API for integration
- ✅ Proper dependency management

## 🎉 Conclusion

Your project has been successfully transformed from a collection of scripts into a **professional Python package** that can be:
- Easily installed with pip
- Imported and used programmatically
- Integrated into other projects
- Distributed via PyPI
- Used by other developers without complex setup

The package maintains all existing functionality while adding a clean, professional interface suitable for production use.
